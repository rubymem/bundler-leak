## Description

Patch-level verification for [bundler].

## Features

* Checks for memory leaks of gems in `Gemfile.lock`.
* Prints memory leak information.
* Does not require a network connection.

## Synopsis

Audit a project's `Gemfile.lock`:

```shell
    $ bundle leak

    Name: celluloid
    Version: 0.17.0
    URL: https://github.com/celluloid/celluloid/issues/670
    Title: Memory Leak using Celluloid::Future
    Solution: remove or disable this gem until a patch is available!

    Name: therubyracer
    Version: 0.12.1
    URL: https://github.com/cowboyd/therubyracer/pull/336
    Title: Memory leak in WeakValueMap
    Solution: upgrade to ~> 0.12.3

    Unpatched versions found!
```

Update the [ruby-mem-advisory-db] that `bundle leak` uses:

```shell
    $ bundle leak update

    cd data/ruby-mem-advisory-db
    git pull origin master
    remote: Enumerating objects: 14, done.
    remote: Counting objects: 100% (14/14), done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.
    remote: Total 9 (delta 5), reused 7 (delta 4), pack-reused 0
    Unpacking objects: 100% (9/9), done.
